# Usecase
In this scenario we are demonstrating the below listed usecases.

 - Loading from a CSV file
 - Connecting to a locally hosted database
 - Identifying the Duplicates with DATA available into DB tabble; Comparing the data to ensure only unique values get processed
 - Connecting to Salesforce
 - Updating the salesforce Order object with unique order details.
 
We are demonstrating the same usecase using two different integration patterns. 
1. APILed Integration pattern - using a microservices architecture to divide a functionality into smaller services and those services can be used individually. Ex. Creating Object in Salesforce, or findong duplicates for incoming data against db, etc.

2. Traditional Integration approach - One flow contains all the business logic (the cluttered way to doing it).
